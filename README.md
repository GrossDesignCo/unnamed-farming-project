Is it possible to codify farming wisdom?

Notes:

It would be really neat to write software to support small independant farms 
Could hypothetically contribute to [citizen science projects](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/idea/citizen-science-projects/?page=3)

## Key Principles

Sustainability

- Has to help farmers be sustainable for the long term.
- Dollar maximization in the short-term is useless if it's a net-loss in the long term.

Wisdom

- Has to promote real wisdom over catchy BS
- Common ideas in farming today could be useless in certain times/places
- Teach people how to really take care of the land


## Feature Ideas

Topography-based Soil Stats

- Take in location, topology data, weather data, and existing soil samples from all over
- Should be able to estimate soil composition & common problems

Manual Soil Stats

- Teach farmers to test their soil & diagnose issues
- Provides crowdsourced soil sample data
- Provides record keeping for farmers
- Give recommendations for modifications to soil for different types of crops
- Give recommendations for co-planting to naturally amend soil

Swales & Water flow mapping?

- No idea how this would work, but would be awesome if we could help people make improvements to their land in water capture

Crop tracking + history

- Track crops in specific fields
- 3D map of fields & topology
- Track performance of crops (both in yield and in dollars, extrapolate to dollars per acre per day of time)

Solar + Crop co-planting

- Manage solar production
- Estimate soloar yields + effect on crops planted underneath (cost/benefit recommendations)

Put anecdotal evidence to the test

- Provide anecdotal recommendations
- Record results across farms that tried anecdotal recommendations
- Compile stats on conditions for success/failure of anecdotes
- Research on common anecdotes & where they come from (see Gardening Myths by that british author)

Connect similar farms

- Show farms with similar weather, lattitude, topology, conditions
- Allow farmers to share strategies directly with other farmers in other parts of the world

Connect farms to customers?

- Interface with services like Doordash?
- Collective interface for farmers markets?
- Collective supply for local grocery stores/restaurants/food banks?

## Physical Product Ideas

Bird Tracker

- Microphone on a stick
- Records sounds throughout the day (maybe once a week or something)
- Matches sounds to bird species

Light Sensor

- Plan for solar panels
- Light sensor on a stick
- Measure lumens once / hour (or something)
