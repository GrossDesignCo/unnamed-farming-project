Is it possible to codify farming wisdom?

Notes:

It would be really neat to write software to support small independant farms 
Could hypothetically contribute to [citizen science projects](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/idea/citizen-science-projects/?page=3)

## Feature Ideas

Topography-based Soil Stats

- Take in location, topology data, weather data, and existing soil samples from all over
- Should be able to estimate soil composition & common problems

Manual Soil Stats

- Teach farmers to test their soil & diagnose issues
- Provides crowdsourced soil sample data
- Provides record keeping for farmers
- Give recommendations for modifications to soil for different types of crops
- Give recommendations for co-planting to naturally amend soil

Crop histories

- Track crops in specific fields
- 3D map of fields & topology
- Track performance of crops (both in yield and in dollars, extrapolate to dollars per acre per day of time)

Solar + Crop co-planting

- Manage solar production
- Estimate soloar yields + effect on crops planted underneath (cost/benefit recommendations)

Put anecdotal evidence to the test

- Provide anecdotal recommendations
- Record results across farms that tried anecdotal recommendations
- Compile stats on conditions for success/failure of anecdotes

Connect similar farms

- Show farms with similar weather, lattitude, topology, conditions
- Allow farmers to share strategies directly with other farmers in other parts of the world

Connect farms to customers?

- Interface with services like Doordash?
- Collective interface for farmers markets?
- Collective supply for local grocery stores/restaurants/food banks?

## Physical Product Ideas

Bird Tracker

- Microphone on a stick
- Records sounds throughout the day (maybe once a week or something)
- Matches sounds to bird species

Light Sensor

- Plan for solar panels
- Light sensor on a stick
- Measure lumens once / hour (or something)
